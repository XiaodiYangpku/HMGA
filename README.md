### HMGA (Hematologic Malignancy Genomic Atlas) ###
Here, we use cancer gene panel sequencing data from AACR GENIE (release 13.1, https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51355584) to explore the clinical and genetic distinctions between Children and youngy adults (CYAs) and older adults (OAs) in hematologic malignancies. We compared their sex, ethnicity, and metastasis rates at the levels of various hematologic tumor types/subtypes. As for genomic feature characterization, we calculated and compared their tumor mutational burden, gene mutation rates, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. By integrating human protein interactions and functional gene sets, we analyzed the network topologies and functional implications of our identified differentially mutated genes (DMGs) of CYAs and OAs. Finally, we investigated the clinical actionability of these genetic variations, providing a comprehensive landscape view of their therapeutic implications.
